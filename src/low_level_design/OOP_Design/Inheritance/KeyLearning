Definition:
A mechanism where one class inherits properties and behaviors from another class.

Example:
SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount inherit from BankAccount to reuse common functionality.

Importance:
Enables code reuse, promotes hierarchical design, and supports extensibility.

Implementation:
Use inheritance keywords (e.g., extends in Java, : in C++) to define child classes from a parent class.
