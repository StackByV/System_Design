Principle: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Definition: Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

How: Use interfaces or abstract classes. Extend via new subclasses, not by altering core logic.

Example: EmailNotification, SMSNotification implement Notification interface.

Benefit: Easy to add new features without changing tested code.
