Principle: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Definition: No client should be forced to implement methods it doesnâ€™t use.

Violation: Large interfaces with unrelated methods (e.g., Robot having to eat).

Fix: Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

Benefit: Better modularity, fewer bugs, easier to maintain/test.
