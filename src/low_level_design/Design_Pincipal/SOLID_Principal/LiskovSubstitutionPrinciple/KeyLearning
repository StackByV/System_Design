Principle: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Definition: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

Real-World Analogy
If you replace a CreditCardPayment with a DebitCardPayment, the system should behave properly
— because both are types of Payment and follow the same rules.

Rule: Don’t override or change behavior in a way that breaks expectations of the base class.

Violation: Ostrich subclass of Bird throws error in fly().

Fix: Separate non-flying birds from flying birds using interfaces.

Benefit: Ensures safe and logical inheritance.
