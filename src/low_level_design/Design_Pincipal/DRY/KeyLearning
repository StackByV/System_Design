Principle: DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)
Goal: Avoid duplicating logic or knowledge in code

Bad: Copy-paste the same code in multiple places
Good: Abstract and reuse functionality

Benefits: Less bugs, better maintainability, scalable code

Common Ways to Break DRY
-Copy-pasting the same logic into different functions
-Duplicating SQL queries or constants across files
-Writing similar code blocks with minor changes
